# Competitive Programming Runbook
During the years I spent playing around with competetive programming, here's an archive I prepared for the most useful reusable content I have been through.
I'm in the phase of collecting all my codes, making them generic enough to be understood/reused, and put it here.
Feel free to contribute, but make sure to maintain the quality - 
<ul>
<li>Don't add a problem's solution here, as that's not reusable.</li>
<li>Let's have generic snippets one can refer for learning algo/implementation</li>
</ul>
